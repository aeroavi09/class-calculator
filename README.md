Class Calculator is a simple-to-use GPA calculator for students that is made with the student's experience in mind. It saves data, has an eye-appealing design, and a simple interface.

Class Calculator consists of the Calculator webpage, where the student goes to add all their courses. They can update their grades, and change their course type, or delete courses. After the student has made all the modifications the Calculator will find their unweighted and weighted GPA.

The calculator was created using HTML, Javascript, and CSS. 
The main.js has functions like - 
webLoaded() which loads saved data, 
editValue() which is invoked when a value in a course is changed,
createDiv() which creates a new course,
deleteCourse() which deletes a course,
updateGPA() which updates the GPA, 
calculateWeightedGPA(), and calculatedUnweightedGPA() which calculates unweighted and weighted GPA

To use the project, the student will navigate to the calculator from the home page and press "Add Course" which will create a new course template. Afterward, they will make changes to the template like changing the course name to match their schedule, and updating the grades and course type. Once they have added all the courses, the calculator will automatically calculate their unweighted and weighted GPA.
